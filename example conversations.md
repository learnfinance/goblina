can you think of a phrase for this image
You said:
in this prompt, the manager is saying "micromanager" - Prompt:
A 3D cartoon scene inside a dimly lit open-plan office. A green-skinned goblin woman, “Ms. Goblina,” sits at her desk typing on her laptop. Her annoyed manager, a tall brown-skinned woman in a white shirt, leans over and points at the screen. Ms. Goblina looks up, rolls her eyes slightly, smirks and says, “Micromanager? Meet my macro boundaries.” The manager looks surprised, blinks, then sighs and rolls her eyes. Subtle office background motion and glowing monitor light.

can you change this prompt for only the goblin to say her speech whilst the manager is only reacting

can you create a promt and scene with this where the goblin says - pause the scroll, solve us and create an argument where the girl can be right but so can the boyfriend

In this prompt - the manager was still speaking - Prompt

A 3D cartoon scene in a dimly lit open-plan office. A green-skinned goblin woman, “Ms. Goblina,” sits at her desk typing on a laptop. Her annoyed manager, a tall brown-skinned woman in a white shirt, leans over and points at the screen. Ms. Goblina looks up, rolls her eyes slightly, smirks, and says: “Micromanager? Meet my macro boundaries.”
The manager does not speak—she only reacts: startled expression, brief blink, then a silent eye-roll and exhale. Subtle office background motion and monitor glow.

can you create another scenario of a boyfriend girfriend argument, where they both are right and is relevant to gen z relationship - Dialogue (balanced argument)

Ms. Goblina (speaks): “Pause the scroll, solve us. We’ve postponed this three times—when your screen wins, I feel like I don’t.”

Boyfriend (speaks): “I hear you. I just walked in—I need ten minutes to decompress or I shut down.”

Ms. Goblina (speaks): “Fair. I need presence so I don’t spiral.”

Boyfriend (speaks): “Deal: timer for ten, then phones down, we talk.”

Ms. Goblina (speaks, softer): “Phones down. Us up.”

Note: The argument gives her a valid need for attention/presence, and him a valid need for a cool-down window—both “right,” resolved with a time-boxed pause + device-down rule.

Optional on-screen text / subtitle

“Pause the scroll, solve us.” (appears as she says the line)

Want a shorter 6-second version or an alt take (budget vs. time, chores vs. rest)?

You're right—some generators infer extra dialogue unless we hard-mute the other character. Use this tightened version:

Paste-ready prompt (single speaker)

A 3D cartoon, dim open-plan office. Ms. Goblina (green skin, hoodie, gold bangles) types at a laptop. Her annoyed manager (tall, brown-skinned, white shirt) leans over and points at the screen. Ms. Goblina looks up, rolls her eyes, smirks, and says: “Micromanager? Meet my macro boundaries.”
Manager is silent. She only reacts: startles, blinks once, then silent eye-roll and long exhale.
Medium two-shot; slight push-in on Goblina during the line; hold on manager’s reaction. Fluorescent office lighting, soft shadows, subtle background motion and monitor glow.

Hard constraints (add below if your tool supports notes/metadata):

Single speaker audio track: Ms. Goblina only.

Manager: no dialogue, no subtitles, no lip movement.

Avoid generating any extra lines or VO from the manager.

If breath/sigh is shown, keep mouth closed; treat as non-verbal.

Optional negative prompt:
no second voice, no extra captions, no manager speaking, no talking animation for manager, no added dialogue.
