5. **Brand consistency** - "Use exact character description"

### ⚠️ When to Keep AI Prompt:

## 🎓 Learning from Prompts

### Save Successful Prompts:

When a prompt produces great results:
1. Copy the edited prompt
2. Note what worked (camera, lighting, etc.)
3. Reuse patterns in future content

### Example Pattern Library:

```javascript
// Office Humor Pattern
"3D cartoon office scene. Ms. Goblina at desk.
 Static shot, push-in to close-up during reaction.
 Soft fluorescent lighting, subtle office background.
 Medium-close final framing."

// Life Struggle Pattern  
"3D cartoon bathroom scene. Ms. Goblina crying.
 Handheld camera for emotional authenticity.
 Dramatic lighting shift when she notices reflection.
 Close-up final shot on facial expression."

// Relationship Pattern
"3D cartoon home scene. Ms. Goblina and partner.
 Two-shot, medium framing, sitting on couch.
 Warm home lighting, cozy atmosphere.
 Cut between faces for dialogue."
```
