## 🎨 Example Edits

### AI Generated:
```
A 3D cartoon office scene. Ms. Goblina sits at laptop
and looks surprised.
```

### Your Edit:
```
A 3D cartoon office scene. Ms. Goblina (green-skinned
goblin woman, casual purple hoodie, gold bangles) sits
at laptop in dim fluorescent office lighting. Camera
push-in from medium to close-up as she sees Slack
message on screen: "Quick question". Her eyes widen
dramatically, she turns to camera breaking the 4th wall,
and screams "Hell no!" with exaggerated cartoon expression.
Medium-close final framing, dynamic camera movement,
fast-paced witty Gen Z meme style.
```

**Result:** More specific, better video!
